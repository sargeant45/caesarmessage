        <p>Caesarmessage is Classmessage in “dpnqmfuf kjccfsjti.” (you can decode that yourself with caesarmessage!)</p>

        <p>Caesarmessage is slightly fun to play around with, and I’ve found it is especially useful for when you are sitting next to your friend, but can’t talk because you have to be silent during class. If you get caught, your teacher will most likely never read your message!</p>
        
        <p>Caesarmessage uses an ancient cipher called the “Caesar cipher”, which is where the name comes from. It works by using a specific number (called the “shift”) which… <em>shifts</em>… each letter in your message over by that number.</p>

        <h4 id="encoding-and-decoding">Encoding and Decoding</h4>
        
        <p>You can put regular text or encoded text in the textbox. If you want to show the message in code to a friend, press <code>Encode</code> and it will come up in the large text display. If a friend shows you a message, you can write it in the textbox and press <code>Decode</code> to see the message in the large text display in plain English.</p>
        
        <h4 id="shift">Shift</h4>
        
        <p>Shift is the amount of letters your message will be shifted. You can change this yourself and encode your message differently. <br>
        Remember: the thing at the end of the message (<code>set shift to: ##</code>) is important. You will not decode the message correctly unless you set your shift to the number shown.</p>
